# Advent of Code 2023

A collection of my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

## Usage

My solutions are generally written in Python and use pytest.
Individual days can be run like `python -m day01 [input_file]`.
